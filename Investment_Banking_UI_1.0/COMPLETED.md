# Task Completed

I have updated the step sequencer so that each layer has a unique, high-contrast color within the palette's theme.
- **Kick**: Primary Red (`#D16666`)
- **Snare**: Light Grey (`#C1C1C1`)
- **Hi-Hat**: Light Red/Pink (`#FF9B9B`)
- **Clap**: Steel Blue (`#6B8CA3`)
- **Synth**: Muted Salmon (`#E6A5A5`)
- **Piano**: Cool Grey (`#94A3B8`)
- **Bass**: Mauve (`#B37D88`)

These colors are selected to be distinct from each other and clearly visible against the dark background.
Please check `components/music-lab/Sequencer.tsx` and the `walkthrough.md` for details.
